# Module 19 Challenge: PWA: Just Another Text Editor (J.A.T.E.)

## Description
The task is to build a text editor that runs in a brower. The app will be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancies in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.

## User Story

* I WANT: to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection.
* SO THAT: I can reliably retrieve them for later use.

## Built-With:

* webpack
* workbox
